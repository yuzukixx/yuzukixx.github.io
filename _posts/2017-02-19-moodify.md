A few weeks back, I was at the annual Hack&Roll with some friends and we created a Telegram bot called moodify! 
<!-- more -->

moodify was created to recommend a Spotify playlist based on mood. Selfies sent to it are analysed for mood using the Microsoft Emotion API, and the result was used to pick a random playlist that suits your mood.


Try it out at [moodifybot](http://t.me/moodifybot), or check out our [Github repo](http://github.com/samsontmr/moodify).
