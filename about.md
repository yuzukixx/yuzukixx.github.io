## hello!

my name is sherry, and I run this blog. .. and maybe some interpolation (amsi) is a chronicle of cool tech stuff that i'm experimenting with,
especially anything regarding my chief interest in data and machine learning algorithms.

i also like rhythm games, cute animals, and lowercase letters.

i am social media-shy, but feel free to contact me about anything through the contact form on the top right.

currently looking for internships :)
